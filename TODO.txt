Render-to-texture
=================

- Render scene to a texture.

- Render the texture on a screen aligned quad to do post-processing with a
  fragment shader.


Lighting
========

- Lights to be stored in scene graph nodes, so they can be transformed along
  with the other node contents.

- Before rendering we'll walk the scene graph once to gather all the light
  positions and transform them into world coordinates.

- We'll need to pass separate matrices into the shaders for the local-to-world,
  world-to-camera and camera-to-viewport transforms. (Might be able to combine
  the last two - look into this...).

- Add code to the shaders to do the lighting calculations. (Or should we do
  these as separate passes...?)
